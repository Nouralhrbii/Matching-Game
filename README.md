# Matching-Game
Project Overview The objective is to demonstrate mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by building a browser-based card matching game.

How to Play the Game:

The game board consists of sixteen cards arranged randomly in a grid. The deck is made up of eight pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match. On each turn:

-The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol. -The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol. -If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over. -If the cards do not match, both cards are returned to their initial hidden state. -The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.

Special Features:

-The game features a timer to keep track of how long it takes to win and reports time on win screen. -The player starts out with a three star rating -- but the rating drops the more moves it take to complete the game. -When the game ends, a pop-up appears with the elapsed time, final star rating and a restart button.
